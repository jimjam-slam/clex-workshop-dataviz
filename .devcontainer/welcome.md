# CLEX Datavis Workshop

Welcome — looks like you made it!

Over on the left are your files (if you don't see a sidebar, click the top-left icon that looks like two pages).

There are two you'll be using today:

1. To follow along with the slides I'm presenting, open `slides.qmd`. Then click the Preview button in the top-right of the editor (it looks a bit like a newspaper) to open them in your browser.

2. To go through the exercises, open `exercises.qmd`. Inside that file, you can run code by either:

- clicking "▷ Run cell" above any chunk of code, or
- selecting code and then pressing Ctrl+Enter (on Windows) or Cmd+Enter (on Mac)

If the Codespace looks like it's not working, close the tab and return to the original link. You can reopen it from there, or even destroy it and make another one to start from scratch.
