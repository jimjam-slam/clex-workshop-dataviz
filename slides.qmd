## Poll {{< bi person-raised-hand >}} {.center}

- What are you hoping to learn today?
- How comfortable do you feel with R and ggplot2?

# Plotting principles {.section-sunset background="linear-gradient(45deg, #c21500, #ffc500)"}

## Who is your graphic for? {.center .hcenter}

A lot of data vis advice is just communication advice!
<br><br>
**Who** is your plot for?

**What** do you need them to know or do?

**When and how** will they see your plot?

What are they likely to **know already?**

## What will your readers see first? {.center .hcenter}

Information designers call this **visual hierarchy**.
<br><br>
What did you see first on this slide? What did you see second?

Why?

## {.center .hcenter}

When all of the elements on your plot look the same, it's really hard for people to decide what to focus on. Without that focus, it's difficult for your plot to lead to a conclusion. Instead, you want to vary your plot elements, drawing attention to the most important things first. There are lots of ways to do this: bolding text, making it bigger, using colours, and taking advantage of natural reading direction can all help to establish visual hierarchy.

## Visual hierarchy: text size
<br><br>
[People read large things first...]{style="font-size: 125%"}

[... and smaller things later.]{style="font-size: 75%"}
<br><br>
[(There's a reason we call it "fine print".)]{style="font-size: 50%"}

## Visual hierarchy: font weight

(more or less bold)

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

[What did you read first here?]{style="font-size: 75%"}
<br><br><br><br>

:::{.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Be careful using the more extreme weights (300 and 900).

Text still needs to be readable!

:::{.column width="50%" style="font-family: system-ui"}

[Text weight: 300]{style="font-weight: 300"}

[Text weight: 400]{style="font-weight: 400"}

[Text weight: 500]{style="font-weight: 500"}

[Text weight: 600]{style="font-weight: 600"}

[Text weight: 700]{style="font-weight: 700"}

[Text weight: 800]{style="font-weight: 800"}

##Visual hierarchy: reading direction

Left-to-right?

Right-to-left?

Top-to-bottom?

This might depend on your audience!

## Building up visual hierarchy
<br><br>

[Visual hierarchy guides the reader]{style="font-size:125%; color: #dd0033; font-weight: bold;"}

And we have many ways to build it

[James made this slide, but that's less important]{style="font-size:75%; color: #bbbbbb"}

## Building up visual hierarchy

### 

You can also use these elements against each other to fine-tune your visual hierarchy...
<br><br>
...but you need to make sure you don't make things too confusing!

<br>

[Important thing right here!]{style="font-size: 125%; font-weight: bold;"}

## When to draw things, and when not to {.center .hcenter}

Some data vis practitioners refer to a principle called the **data-to-ink ratio**
<br><br>
The idea is to minimise the amount of "ink" for the amount of data you're trying to convey.

## When to draw things, and when not to {.center .hcenter}

It's definitely possible to take this principle **too far**â€”sometimes redundancy can be helpful for people!
<br><br>
But it's always worth asking the **purpose plot elements serve**, and whether your plot has a focus or is **too busy**

## One story, or multiple? {.center .hcenter}

If your plot has too many things, or is **trying to tell multiple stories at once**, think about how you can help readers **build up** to that complexity:

:::::{style="margin-block: 30px"}
::::{.columns style="font-size: 75%;"}
:::{.column width="30%"}
Use animation to introduce elements one at a time
:::
:::{.column width="30%"}
Make more than one plot
:::

:::{.column width="30%"}
De-emphasise less important info or emphasise more important info
:::
::::
:::::

More complex graphics can be useful when exploring... but in those cases **you** are the audience, and **you know your data best!**

## Building up complexity

```{r}
#| label: pre-data
#| echo: false
#| output: false
set.seed(0)
deemph_data = tibble(
  names = c("Sasha Pearson", "Gunner Galindo", "Corinne Castillo",
    "Kai McKenzie", "Briar Pena", "Marcus Cardenas", "Raven Alfaro",
    "Xzavier Hoffman", "Aspen Wade", "Jake Shah", "Angelica Olson",
    "Malachi Villalobos", "Zoya Bridges", "Mohammed Wilson", "Luna Rowland"),
  score = rnorm(15, 5, 2),
  practice = seq(4, 11, 0.5) + rnorm(15, 2, 1),
  cat = "deemph")
emph_data = tibble(
  names = "Outstanding Person",
  score = 14.5,
  practice = 1.5)
all_data = bind_rows(deemph_data, emph_data)

# [Exercise 1]{.small}<br>Plotting for publication {.section-indigo background="linear-gradient(45deg, #4776e6, #8e54e9)"}

## Exercise 1 {.center}

Open `exercises.qmd`

<br>
This notebook compares peak electricity demand each day to maximum temperature at 3 sites
<br><br>
We'll split into groups and try to make a better plot **for publication**
<br><br>
Start by discussing improvements you'd make. If you know R, try making these changes! If not, I have some suggestions you can copy further down ðŸ˜‰

# [Exercise 2]{.small}<br>Plotting for the public{.section-moss background="linear-gradient(45deg, #134e5e, #71b280)"}

## Exercise 2 {.center}

Continue down `exercises.qmd` file to Exercise 2

<br>
This notebook shows **temperatures across Australia** over the course of two hot days.
<br><br>
We also have data on regions in New South Wales.
<br><br>
Think about the kinds of questions you could answer with this data.

Start by **discussing improvements** you'd make. If you know R, **try making these changes!** If not, I have some suggestions you can copy further down ðŸ˜‰

# Thank you for having me!

Thanks **Mat Lipson** and the [**NEAR program**](https://near.csiro.au/) (BOM + CSIRO) for our time series data!
