# Plotting principles {.section-sunset background="linear-gradient(45deg, #c21500, #ffc500)"}

## Who is your graphic for? {.center .hcenter}

A lot of data vis advice is just communication advice!
<br><br>
**Who** is your plot for?

**What** do you need them to know or do?

**When and how** will they see your plot?

What are they likely to **know already?**

## When to draw things, and when not to {.center .hcenter}

Some data vis practitioners refer to a principle called the **data-to-ink ratio**
<br><br>
The idea is to minimise the amount of "ink" for the amount of data you're trying to convey.

## When to draw things, and when not to {.center .hcenter}

It's definitely possible to take this principle **too far**—sometimes redundancy can be helpful for people!
<br><br>
But it's always worth asking the **purpose plot elements serve**, and whether your plot has a focus or is **too busy**

## One story, or multiple? {.center .hcenter}

If your plot has too many things, or is **trying to tell multiple stories at once**, think about how you can help readers **build up** to that complexity:

:::::{style="margin-block: 30px"}
::::{.columns style="font-size: 75%;"}
:::{.column width="30%"}
Use animation to introduce elements one at a time
:::
:::{.column width="30%"}
Make more than one plot
:::

:::{.column width="30%"}
De-emphasise less important info or emphasise more important info
:::
::::
:::::

More complex graphics can be useful when exploring... but in those cases **you** are the audience, and **you know your data best!**

# [Exercise 1]{.small}<br>Plotting for publication {.section-indigo background="linear-gradient(45deg, #4776e6, #8e54e9)"}

## Exercise 1 {.center .hcenter}

Open `exercises.qmd`.  
It has daily data from 3 sites on:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}

{{< bi lightning-fill >}}  
Daily electricity demand

:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

{{< bi sun-fill >}}  
Maximum daily temperature

## Exercise 1: ggplot2 crash course

::: {.columns}
::: {.column .small width="40%"}

We're using the `{ggplot2}` package today! With `{ggplot2}`, you:

- tell it **how columns in your data relate to its appearance**, and
- **add things together** to create a plot

Here're some examples of things you might add:

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}

```r
# tell ggplot2 which data to plot
ggplot(df_long) +

  # tell ggplot2 which data columns mean what
  aes(x = tmax, y = demand, colour = working) +

  # geoms add layers to your plot. these are points
  geom_point(size = 2) +

  # facets split your data up into different panels
  facet_wrap(vars(name)) +

  # add titles, labels for axes and legends, etc.
  labs(
    x = "2m air temperature [°C]",
    y = "Electricity demand [MW]")
```

  # geoms add layers to your plot. these are points
  geom_point(size = 2) +

  # facets split your data up into different panels
  facet_wrap(vars(name)) +

  # add titles, labels for axes and legends, etc.
  labs(
    x = "2m air temperature [°C]",
    y = "Electricity demand [MW]")
```

# More plotting principles {.section-sunset background="linear-gradient(45deg, #c21500, #ffc500)"}

## What will your readers see first? {.center .hcenter}

Information designers call this **visual hierarchy**.
<br><br>
What did you see first on this slide? What did you see second?

Why?

## {.center .hcenter}

When all of the elements on your plot look the same, it's really hard for people to decide what to focus on. Without that focus, it's difficult for your plot to lead to a conclusion. Instead, you want to vary your plot elements, drawing attention to the most important things first. There are lots of ways to do this: bolding text, making it bigger, using colours, and taking advantage of natural reading direction can all help to establish visual hierarchy.

Be careful using the more extreme weights (300 and 900).

Text still needs to be readable!

[Text weight: 700]{style="font-weight: 700"}

##Visual hierarchy: reading direction

Left-to-right?

Right-to-left?

Top-to-bottom?

This might depend on your audience!

## Building up visual hierarchy
<br><br>

[Visual hierarchy guides the reader]{style="font-size:125%; color: #dd0033; font-weight: bold;"}

And we have many ways to build it

[James made this slide, but that's less important]{style="font-size:75%; color: #bbbbbb"}

## Building up visual hierarchy

### 

You can also use these elements against each other to fine-tune your visual hierarchy...
<br><br>
...but you need to make sure you don't make things too confusing!

# [Exercise 2]{.small}<br>Plotting for the public{.section-moss background="linear-gradient(45deg, #134e5e, #71b280)"}

## Exercise 2 {.center}

Take the **same plot** we worked on before...

... but this time, you are making it to go in a **newspaper story**

**Who is the audience?** What do they know (or not know)?

## Adding text annotations {.center}


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column .small width="40%"}

Text annotations let you **describe what's happening**... but they can be fiddly

Matt Cowgill @ SEEK made `{ggannotate}`. It **helps you place annotations!**

**Run `ggannotate::ggannotate()` to use it →**

[(it gives you ggplot2 code that you can copy in!)]{.small}
